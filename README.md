### Notes about my code
As always I find these coding test enjoyable and had a good time doing this one for GSL!
<br />
I have commented my code a fair bit but to keep things a bit more organised as well I will explain my processes here too.
<br />
#### The stack I used:
I used React with functional components -> using the new Hooks for local statemanagement, and I used Redux for the whole app state management.
For styling I used styled-components and styled objects which are all stored in a styles.js variables file and a globals file for my whole page styling (I created and darkmode and lightmode for the app).
<br />
I created a components folder where I stored my individual components and a redux folder for my actions and reducers.
<br />
I didn't want to spend too much time on the task than needed so just built the app for desktop screens only (no mobile responsiveness but I would use things like media queries and breakpoints to handle that).
